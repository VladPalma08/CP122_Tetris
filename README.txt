Directions:

Simply open the JAR file "Tetris [Java]" in the project folder.
If there is a case that the application runs but does not contain images or sounds,
then I will need to find a way to implement them during the project's conversion to JAR.

To run the program in an IDE, "Tetris.java" is the file to compile and run.

Program Controls: (Arrow Keys and Spacebar)

Down: Slowly drops the current block
Left: Moves the block towards the left
Right: Moves the block towards the right

Up: Rotates the current block
Spacebar: Immediately drops the current block


Project Description:

Tetris is a puzzle game that prompts players to complete lines by moving different shaped pieces around a playing field. 
The pieces slowly descend down the play field while the player has options to rotate the shape at 90ยบ intervals. 
A standard play field is 10 blocks wide and 20 blocks high. When a player completes a line they are rewarded points. 
The game ends when the unfinished lines reach the top of the play field and the player can no longer place any shapes. 
The longer the player can remain in the game the faster pieces will fall, making the game more difficult. 
Oftentimes, there is also a feature that allows the player to move a piece down instantly. 

My program aims to create a functioning Tetris game with blocks that fall in random order. 
Connecting these blocks will grant the player a certain amount of points. The program will solve issues including the calculation of points,
the implementation of a user interface and controls, and the creation of graphics.
