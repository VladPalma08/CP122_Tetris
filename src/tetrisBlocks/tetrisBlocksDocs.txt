Each shape extends TetrisBlock, and this is how each shape is intialized.
Each shape creates a 2D array list filled with 1s and 0s to represent blocks 
that should be colored and blocks that should be left empty. Each block is then 
given its own image file which is used in next block and returns that in the 
abstract method getImage that exists in TetrisBlock.
